If you came here because you were looking for [sample search](https://0px.moe/samplesearch/), don't worry, it's still alive. I just forgot to renew the domain name. Mostly because *sampled.pro* wasn't a very good name, and because it's surprisingly expensive to renew .pro domains. Who would've thought a $0.99 domain name would cost $15 to renew?  
{% include cont.html %}In other news for sample search, it getting new features is kind of up in the air. I feel that it's in a pretty good spot in terms of **what it is** and **what it does**. I wouldn't want to over engineer and take away from the site as a whole. I think the most I'll be doing is removing the ad bar from the site since I no longer have to pay for a domain name and I only made about... $0.13 for the *entire year of 2018*.

            caption="My attempt at internet ad revenue" %}

Anyways, here's the link for [sample search](https://0px.moe/samplesearch/) once again. I'll keep this blog post pinned to the top of the site for a while, but I'd recommend bookmarking sample search if you use it a lot.

Have fun!
