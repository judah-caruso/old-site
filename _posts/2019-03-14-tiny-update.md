**여러분 안녕하세요! 오랜만이에요** --
Hey everyone, it's been a while! If you're an avid reader of my *incredibly* active blog,
you might've noticed that there's a few things going on. First off, the footer
is actually at the bottom of the website now. Incredible web design skill, I know.
Second, pinned posts! These will mostly be updates, but if I write an article
or something I'm proud of (in the near future maybe?), I'll probably pin it.  

Moving on to **THE FUTURE**, I have a few programming projects I'm working on
that I definitely want to show off, as well as a possible video series coming out. I don't want to give too much away about either, but I will say that they have something to do with **Language**; one a little more than the other.

Anyways, more things planned for this blog/website/whatever this is in the near future.

Stay well,  
-- Judah
