Wow, this thing actually works! Needless to say getting this set up wasn't the funnest thing I've ever done, but it's done so I can't complain.

Anyways, welcome to the site! I intend to post a lot on here. From development updates for things I work on to music production tutorials and everything in-between. Maybe even some web design, who knows?!

### So why "0px", and why ".moe?"

Well, 0px because I feel like it's a name that's **50% web development** and **50% design/art**. Which, *to me*, has a nice balance. 
Plus I'm absolutely terrible at coming up with names. As for the .moe, I recently got back into playing <a class="showlink" href="http://osu.ppy.sh">osu!</a>, that japanese-esque rhythm game (it's great, you should check it out). And while I'm not particularly a fan of Anime---I've seen a few and have my favorites, but I'm not really into it---I can still appreciate the music and enjoy the game. I then thought a .moe domain would be a "cool" way to stand out a little bit since everyone nowadays has either .com, .io, .net, or .ly.
You know, break up the monotony a bit. Will this be a good idea for the future? Who knows! Do I think it's cool now? *Ehhh*.

Alright, I have to get back to fixing the most annoying DNS issues (I know, right!). I might also change this site or the <a class="showlink" href="http://0px.moe">0px</a> site a little more, so apologies if things look different next time!

Thanks for taking the time out of your day/night to read this, and I'll "see" you all next time!
