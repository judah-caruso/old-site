title: Why you should save demos at a lower quality
mood: music

If you're like me, you probably save your demo mixes at the same quality as your final mixes. 
And while this may seem like a decent idea, it's not in the long-run... unless you have **tons** of storage.
For instance, my old computer only had a `125 GB` hard drive. Add on the fact that I "collected" samples like it was my job;
many demo tracks didn't survive for long.

After having to buy an external hard drive ---the amazing La Cie Rugged `1 TB`---to store my samples and demos, I
decided to go the "Deadmau5" route. Back around 2014--2015, Deadmau5 was releasing a lot of his demos on SoundCloud. 
All of them were pretty low quality, but it made sense. *If you're saving a lot of files, why not make them small?*---Sure you lose out on quality, but you're not generally releasing them commercially.

I decided to follow the trend as well. 


### Why save demos?

Before getting into the actual settings, I'll quickly give reasons why **I** like to save early versions/rough drafts of tracks I make. 
The first is that I listen to the tracks a lot---probably too much---when I'm done with a session. I do this because I like to pick out what's wrong with it. 
*Does it need more elements filling out the background? How well is it mixed overall? Wow, that synth totally doesn't work after all...*

I make sure to do this when I **can't produce**, or **don't want to**. That way when I get back into a session, the most important critiques are remembered.
If I critique from a listener's stand point when I'm producing, it completely changes the feel of the track. *No bueno*.

The second is for sentimental reasons. As much as I *hate* listening to my old tracks, *I kind of love it, too*. I mean, let's be honest... who doesn't like to look at old things they've made and see how terrible it is?
It's like an audible scrapbook.
