I"Á<p>Gridicarus is now stable at <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.1.5</code>! This is the <em>final</em> â€œinitial commitâ€ for Gridicarus. Iâ€™ve gotten the documentation to a point where Iâ€™m happy with the framework, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file is squared away, and I think itâ€™s generally smooth sailing from here. Well, I use smooth sailing looselyâ€¦ The stuff I wanna implement is not going to be fun.</p>
