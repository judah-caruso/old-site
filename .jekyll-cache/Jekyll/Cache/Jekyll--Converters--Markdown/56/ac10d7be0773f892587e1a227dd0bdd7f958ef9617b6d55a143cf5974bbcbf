Hey everyone, itâ€™s been a while! If youâ€™re an avid reader of my <em>incredibly</em> active blog,
you mightâ€™ve noticed that thereâ€™s a few things going on. First off, the footer
is actually at the bottom of the website now. Incredible web design skill, I know.
Second, pinned posts! These will mostly be updates, but if I write an article
or something Iâ€™m proud of (in the near future maybe?), Iâ€™ll probably pin it.</p>

<p>Moving on to <strong>THE FUTURE</strong>, I have a few programming projects Iâ€™m working on
that I definitely want to show off, as well as a possible video series coming out. I donâ€™t want to give too much away about either, but I will say that they have something to do with <strong>Language</strong>; one a little more than the other.</p>

<p>Anyways, more things planned for this blog/website/whatever this is in the near future.</p>

<p>Stay well,<br />
â€“ Judah</p>
