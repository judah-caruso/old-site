I"õ<p>Gridicarus is back and cleaner than ever! Itâ€™s been about a year since the last patch,
mostly because <em>(I thought)</em> I liked how the project ended up and also couldnâ€™t be bothered to update the dependencies.
However! One of the projects Iâ€™m working on could use Gridicarusâ€™ help, so I decided to update itâ€¦ and what I found was shocking! If you donâ€™t care about the changes and just want to know what Iâ€™m talking about, <a href="https://0px.moe/gridicarus/">click here</a>.</p>
