I"T<p>If you came here because you were looking for <a href="https://0px.moe/samplesearch/">sample search</a>, don’t worry, it’s still alive. I just forgot to renew the domain name. Mostly because <em>sampled.pro</em> wasn’t a very good name, and because it’s surprisingly expensive to renew .pro domains. Who would’ve thought a $0.99 domain name would cost $15 to renew?<br />
In other news for sample search, it getting new features is kind of up in the air. I feel that it’s in a pretty good spot in terms of <strong>what it is</strong> and <strong>what it does</strong>. I wouldn’t want to over engineer and take away from the site as a whole. I think the most I’ll be doing is removing the ad bar from the site since I no longer have to pay for a domain name and I only made about… $0.13 for the <em>entire year of 2018</em>.</p>

<p>Anyways, here’s the link for <a href="https://0px.moe/samplesearch/">sample search</a> once again. I’ll keep this blog post pinned to the top of the site for a while, but I’d recommend bookmarking sample search if you use it a lot.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
